## Summary

Using the Open Breweries, Bing Distance Matrix, and Google Maps APIs, we list breweries within a specified mile range from user’s entered location. 

After submitting their starting address, the user will receive a list of brewery results in order of closest to farthest distance. 

Based on information available from Open Brewery API, user will have access to:

• Brewery Name
• Brewery Type
• Brewery Address
• Brewery Website
• Brewery Phone Number

Clicking on the address leads to a new tab opening in Google Maps of the location.

Clicking on the website takes the user to a new tab containing the URL for the website.

Clicking the phone number on a call enabled device will queue the number up for a call.
